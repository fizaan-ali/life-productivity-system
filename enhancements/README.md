## 5. 🔗 Cross-Program Resource Sharing Log

Track instances where study material from one program was reused in another.

| Date | Resource | Source Program | Used In | Time Saved (est.) |
|------|----------|---------------|---------|------------------|

## Implementation Tips

- **Start small**: Pick 2–3 enhancement categories that resonate most and add others later
- **Weekly cadence**: Most enhancements only need weekly updates, not daily
- **Batch updates**: Update all enhancement trackers in a single weekly review session
- **Focus on trends**: Individual data points matter less than patterns over time
- **Drop what doesn't help**: If a tracker isn't providing useful insights after a month, stop tracking it
